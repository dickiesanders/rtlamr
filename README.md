### Purpose

https://hackaday.com/2014/02/25/using-sdr-to-read-your-smart-meter/

Utilities often use "smart meters" to optimize their residential meter reading infrastructure. Smart meters transmit consumption information in the various ISM bands allowing utilities to simply send readers driving through neighborhoods to collect commodity consumption information. One protocol in particular: Encoder Receiver Transmitter by Itron is fairly straight forward to decode and operates in the 900MHz ISM band, well within the tunable range of inexpensive rtl-sdr dongles.

This project is a software defined radio receiver for these messages. We make use of an inexpensive rtl-sdr dongle to allow users to non-invasively record and analyze the commodity consumption of their household.

There's now experimental support for data collection and aggregation with [rtlamr-collect](https://github.com/bemasher/rtlamr-collect)!

### Requirements

- GoLang >=1.3 (Go build environment setup guide: http://golang.org/doc/code.html)
- rtl-sdr
  - Windows: [pre-built binaries](https://ftp.osmocom.org/binaries/windows/rtl-sdr/)
  - Linux: [source and build instructions](http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr)

### Building

This project requires the package [`github.com/bemasher/rtltcp`](http://godoc.org/github.com/bemasher/rtltcp), which provides a means of controlling and sampling from rtl-sdr dongles via the `rtl_tcp` tool. This package will be automatically downloaded and installed when getting rtlamr. The following command should be all that is required to install rtlamr.

    go get github.com/bemasher/rtlamr

This will produce the binary `$GOPATH/bin/rtlamr`. For convenience it's common to add `$GOPATH/bin` to the path.

### Usage

See the wiki page [Configuration](https://github.com/bemasher/rtlamr/wiki/Configuration) for details on configuring rtlamr.

Running the receiver is as simple as starting an `rtl_tcp` instance and then starting the receiver:

```bash
# Terminal A
$ rtl_tcp

# Terminal B
$ rtlamr
```

If you want to run the spectrum server on a different machine than the receiver you'll want to specify an address to listen on that is accessible from the machine `rtlamr` will run on with the `-a` option for `rtl_tcp` with an address accessible by the system running the receiver.

### Message Types

The following message types are supported by rtlamr:

- **scm**: Standard Consumption Message. Simple packet that reports total consumption.
- **scm+**: Similar to SCM, allows greater precision and longer meter ID's.
- **idm**: Interval Data Message. Provides differential consumption data for previous 47 intervals at 5 minutes per interval.
- **netidm**: Similar to IDM, except net meters (type 8) have different internal packet structure, number of intervals and precision. Also reports total power production.
- **r900**: Message type used by Neptune R900 transmitters, provides total consumption and leak flags.
- **r900bcd**: Some Neptune R900 meters report consumption as a binary-coded digits.

### Sensitivity

Using a NooElec NESDR Nano R820T with the provided antenna, I can reliably receive standard consumption messages from ~300 different meters and intermittently from another ~600 meters. These figures are calculated from the number of messages received during a 25 minute window. Reliably in this case means receiving at least 10 of the expected 12 messages and intermittently means 3-9 messages.

### Compatibility

Currently the only tested meter is the Itron C1SR. However, the protocol is designed to be useful for several different commodities and should be capable of receiving messages from any ERT capable smart meter.

Check out the table of meters I've been compiling from various internet sources: [ERT Compatible Meters](https://github.com/bemasher/rtlamr/blob/master/meters.md)

If you've got a meter not on the list that you've successfully received messages from, you can submit this info via a form available at the link above.

### Ethics

_Do not use this for malicious purposes._ If you do, I don't want to know about it, I am not and will not be responsible for your actions. However, if you find a clever non-evil use for this, by all means, share.

### Use Cases

These are a few examples of ways this tool could be used:

**Ethical**

- Track down stray appliances.
- Track power generated vs. power consumed.
- Find a water leak with rtlamr rather than from your bill.
- Optimize your thermostat to reduce energy consumption.
- Mass collection for research purposes. (_Please_ anonymize your data.)

**Unethical**

- Using data collected to determine living patterns of specific persons with the intent to act on this data, particularly without express permission to do so.
